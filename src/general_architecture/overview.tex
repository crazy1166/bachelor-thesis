\section{General overview}
We will here be giving a general overview of the project.

The project is mainly divided in three different parts, 
\begin{description}
\item[Server backend]
  This application main role is to communicate with the X clients, 
  to transfer the requests sent by the X clients to the frontend fo the system, 
  and to transfer back the replies and events sent by the frontend to the 
  X clients. 
  
  Another important role of this application is to store as possible 
  the information held by the client and the frontend in order to, whenever 
  possible avoid unneeded communication by responding directly without 
  needing to transfer any information.

  To illustrate this caching system, let us think about a requests sent by a 
  client to get the background and foreground pixels of a particular 
  subwindow (the root window information being sent on connection). If the 
  backend server was doing any cache work, the request would have to be 
  sent to the frontend application, and then to the client web browser, before 
  getting an answer, which would result in a, depending on the bandwith, 
  quite long latency for a very basic request.
