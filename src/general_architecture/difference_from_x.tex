\section{Differences with a normal X server}
In this section, we will discuss between the main differences of this project 
with a normal X server.
\subsection{Communication through websockets}
A first major difference is that to implement this system, we need 
not only to communicate with X clients using a bytestream such as 
TCP sockets, but we also need to use some communication protocol to 
communicate with a web browser. The chosen protocol to achieve this is 
websockets, we will be discussing further about this decision later in 
this paper.
\subsection{Integrated login manager}
This project goes further from a normal X server in the sense that the 
login manager is integrated and therefore does not depends on the 
X Display Manager Control Protocol.
