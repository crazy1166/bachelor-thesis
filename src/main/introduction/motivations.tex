\subsection{Easy access to Linux}
From its first releases, and during quite a long time, Linux has been quite 
complicated and not very intuitive to use (eg. no graphic installer) for beginners.
In the last few years, Linux has become much simpler to install, and use in general, 
with distributions such as Ubuntu or Fedora integrating a user friendly installer 
and even tools such as Wubi to make the installation possible from Windows.

However, even if the installation process has become much simpler, the fact is that 
a lot of beginners are still having a lot of problems to get a usable programming 
environment. While teaching C programming language as a teacher assistant, I wrote 
on my blog all the steps to get a usable Linux environment, using the simplest 
possible setup ever.
