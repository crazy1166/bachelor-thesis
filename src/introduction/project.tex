\section{About the project}
We will here be giving a short overview of what was tried in this project, 
what can be done and what still needs to be done.
\subsection{Achieved tasks}
One of the main task of this project was to make a communication possible 
between an X client and a modern browser. This is now possible and though 
not all X requests and events are supported yet, they can be added 
simply enough.
A simple application can already be ran using the system, although the 
number of supported requests and replies is still very limited.
\subsection{Tasks to be achieved}
Still only very few requests, replies and events are supported by the 
actual system. In order to be able to respond to real world requests, 
not only those requests will be needed, but some requests and 
other messages that are not defined by the core X protocol will 
be needed. We are now working on extending the base system to support 
these messages, but given the number of message that must be handled, 
the stable release of these is going to take some time.
