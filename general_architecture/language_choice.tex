\section{Language and tool choice}
%
The web browser application is written in JavaScript, and we made the 
choice to avoid any DOM libraries that could potentially slow down the application.
The application however does use KineticJS\footnote{\url{http://www.kineticjs.com/}}
for rendering.
%
The application running on the server has been almost entirely developed in Scala. 
In this section, we will try to discuss objectively a little about 
the motivations for choosing this language.
