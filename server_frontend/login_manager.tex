\subsection{Login manager}
As explained previously, one of the main role of the frontend application is to act 
as a login manager. That is, to check for the user credentials and to start a 
\emph{session} for the user when these are correct.

A large difference with a normal web application is that the sessions used 
in this are completely volatile and only saved on memory, as the only 
information needed in the frontend application is the user name and token to 
authenticate it. Furthermore, once the connection is closed, these information 
can be deleted safely and therefore do not need permanent storage.
