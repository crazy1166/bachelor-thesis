The X protocol is a \windex{network-transparent} protocol for bitmap display. 
It uses a \windex{client-server} architecture, running the server on the computer 
with the display, and makes the connection with local and remote clients possible. 
It is a \windex[binary protocol]{protocol!binary protocol} and can be built on 
top of any reliable byte stream (eg. TCP).
